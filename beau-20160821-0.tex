\input preamble

{\bf Location Beacatcher bridge}

A man parks his car into the corner as he came up the hill.

He sits and waits.

He opens the car door for some fresh air.

A family drive down the old mountain road.  A young man of Irish
decent, his wife and girl.  They stop at the bridge.  Park and take a
stroll into the hilltop.

Walking out, past the first man, he says quietly, John, this'll be the
last time.  And continues away with his family.
